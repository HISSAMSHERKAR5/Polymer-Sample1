Polymer Learning

Steps to run the project
1. Please clone the project and then switch to dev Branch.  
2. Run npm i to download all the required dependencies.
3. Run npm i polymer
4. Run polymer serve --open, this will open http://127.0.0.1:8081/ in your default browser.
5. Click on the "/isbnView/pg1017" link to test isbn-1017 data.
6. I still need to add the test cases, I'm not able to reun test cases in dev mode since my antivirus, is preventing to run WCT.


Happy Learning
Cheers!
